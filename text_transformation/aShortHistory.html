            <span class="placeName">Greater Salem</span>, the province of Governors <span class="persName">Conant</span> and <span class="persName">Endicott</span>, is visited by thousands of sojourners yearly. They come to study the Quakers and
            the witches, to picture the manses of the latter and the stately mansions of <span class="placeName">Salem</span>'s commercial kings, and breathe the salubrious air of "old gray ocean."

            The witchcraft "delusion" is generally the first topic of inquiry, and the earnest
            desire of those people with notebook in hand to aid the memory in chronicling answers,
            suggested this monograph and urged its publication. There is another cogent reason:
            the popular knowledge is circumscribed and even that needs correcting.
            </p>
         <p class="body-p">
            This short history meets that earnest desire; it gives the origin, growth, and death
            of the hideous monster; it gives dates, courts, and names of places, jurors, witnesses,
            and those hanged; it names and explains certain "men and things" that are concomitant
            to the trials, with which the reader may not be conversant and which are necessary
            to the proper setting of the trials in one's mind; it compasses the salient features
            of witchcraft history, so that the story of the <span class="date">1692</span> "delusion" may be garnered and entertainingly rehearsed.
            </p>
         <p class="body-p">
            The trials were all spread upon the records, word for word. <span class="persName">Rev. Samuel Parris</span>, stenographer to the court, says they were "taken down in my characters written at
            the time," barring, of course,

            the evidence by affidavits, which were written, signed, and attested, and filed in
            the Clerk of Court's office, where they may now be seen.

            Great research has hitherto been made, keen, sagacious acumen employed, and much written;
            but the true criterion of judgment, a trial, — a word for word trial, — has not before
            this been published. Here, then, is the first opportunity of readers to judge for
            themselves.
            </p>
         <p class="body-p">
            The trials were unique. The court was without authority; none of the judges, it is
            said, was bred to the law; evidence was arbitrarily admitted or excluded; the accused
            were not allowed counsel in law or the consolation of the clergy in religion.
            </p>
         <p class="body-p">
            The careful reader may discover, between the lines, in questions, in answers, and
            in the strange exhibitions, the real state of mind pervading all, which has been mildly
            characterized as a "delusion"; also he may be able to compare the Mosaic, the <span class="date">1692</span>, and the modern spirit manifestations, and advantageously determine for himself what
            is worth while in modern spiritualism, mindreading, clairvoyance, mesmerism, and the
            rest.
            </p>
         <p class="body-p">
            Though men of education, religion, titled dignity, and official station, of the professions
            and the elite, were responsible for the horrible catastrophy, and in one instance
            or more forced the yeoman jurors to convict (who at the end signed recantations and
            expressed their grief), — religion and education must not be undervalued; a religious
            education will yield the highest type of manhood.
